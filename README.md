# VertexCellModel
To execute code:
type make or do g++ -std=c++11 -g src/main.cpp src/parser.cpp src/polygon.cpp src/geometry.cpp src/vector.cpp src/energy.cpp src/force.cpp src/transitionT1.cpp -o vertexcell

To run:
./vertexcell vertex_file edges_file cells_file

Initial configuration was created with code in directory voronoi, which was based off code from https://github.com/alsignoriello/periodic_voronoi
